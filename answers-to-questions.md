## Answer to Question 1

**Subject:** Re: Inquiry About Mass Member Tagging

Hi there, Great question! 

Currently, just to recap Luma allows you to manage and invite individual members. You can add people to invite through the Calendar > People tab:

1. Go to: http://lu.ma/home/calendars
2. Choose your calendar
3. Open the People tab
4. Add members

Among the options, you can import members using a CSV file, where you can organize and group them by tags beforehand. If this might help, I’d be happy to provide further details or steps!

Here's a concise CSV import example for adding multiple people to your Luma calendar:

```
name,email
John Smith,john.smith@example.com
Jane Doe,jane.doe@example.com
Michael Wong,michael.wong@example.com
```

* The first row is the header, and subsequent rows contain individual member details. 
* You can import this CSV in the People tab of your calendar settings. Remember to use valid email addresses for each member.

After the import, the people you added will be available when you create a new event. You can invite multiple members, filter by tags, and sort by various criteria.

## Answer to Question 2

**Subject: Re: Luma Support Question**

Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out to Luma about your attendees' blocked cards. Resolving this took longer than expected (we understand how frustrating this must be), and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. The team is still looking into this and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

in our [Payment Methods article](https://help.lu.ma/p/helpart-0nXK7uHmN5dTYeB/payment-methods), we outline the different payment methods we accept. Rest assured, Luma uses Stripe as our payment processor, which complies with all necessary security standards, including PCI compliance, to ensure secure transactions. If an attendee’s bank card was blocked, it could be due to their bank flagging the charge, possibly as a precaution against unusual activity. It’s important to note that Luma does not store sensitive payment details — all of that data is handled securely by Stripe.

To help avoid issues like this in the future, I recommend ensuring your event’s payment settings are configured correctly and that your attendees are aware that any temporary hold or "pending" charge on their card is not an actual transaction, but an authorization hold, which is standard with payment processing.

If these issues persist, we recommend reaching out to Stripe support for additional insights or adjusting your payment settings to better align with your attendees' preferences. For more information on how Luma handles payments securely, please refer to our [security article](https://lu.ma/security).

If you need further assistance with specific settings, or to discuss this with Stripe directly, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I'll also be happy to reach out to the affected guest in your behalf. We want to make sure your events always goes smoothly!

Best, Dominic

## Answer to Question 3

**Subject:** Re: Can I use 1 Stripe account for 2 different Luma accounts?

Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out, and I apologize for the delay in getting back to you!

Yes, you can use one Stripe account for multiple Luma accounts. When setting up payments for each event organizer profile, you’ll be able to link the same Stripe account during the payment setup process. This allows you to manage payments for both profiles under a single Stripe account.

In general, If you already have an existing stripe account associated to your email, during the linking process, Stripe will ask you if you want to use your existing registered business, or create a new one. This is true whether or not you created a stripe account through Luma. As such, you can keep reusing the same Stripe account in most platforms (including Luma).

If you’re managing multiple Luma accounts and would like to merge them for easier access, you can follow this guide: [Merging Luma Accounts](https://help.lu.ma/p/helpart-Wq1ZG1jM8av2RdP/merging-luma-accounts). This will help you consolidate your accounts into one.
