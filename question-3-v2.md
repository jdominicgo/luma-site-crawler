Managing Calendar Members
See the list of your calendar members on the Calendar > People tab
​
Calendar
​You can see the list of Calendar Members by opening lu.ma/home/calendars → Choosing a Calendar → then opening the People tab.

​There are a few different ways people are added to that list:

​Someone can Subscribe to your calendar from the public Calendar page.
​You can import people via CSV or by manually entering their emails.
​When a guest registers for an event managed by your calendar, they are automatically added to your People list.
​You can tag members, filter by tags, and sort by name, number of events attended, or number of events checked in.

​When you click on a Calendar Member, you can see more details about them.

​Removing a Member

​From the Calendar Member detail panel, you have a couple options to remove a member:

​Block them so they will not be able to Subscribe in the future or join any of your events.
​Remove them so that they will be opted out of your future Invites and Newsletters. If you Remove a member, they will have the option to subscribe again in the future. So this is a good option if someone has asked you to unsubscribe them.

Luma Calendar Overview
Luma Calendar lets you easily share and manage your events. Every event on Luma is part of a calendar.
​
Calendar
​With Luma Calendar, you can easily host events with your team, share events with your community, curate events, sell tickets, and more.

​Every event on Luma is part of a Calendar. You can see all of the Calendars that you are managing on your Calendars Home.

​Work with Your Team

​When you add admins to your Calendar, they will be able to manage all events that are managed by the Calendar.

​You can easily add your teammates to give them access to all of your events without going to each event individually and adding them as a co-host.

​Share Your Calendar Page

​Your Calendar page is a customizable, beautiful website that showcases all of your upcoming events. Visitors can filter events by tags, explore events on a map, and subscribe to keep up with updates.

​Send Newsletters

​When guests subscribe to your Calendar, you'll be able to send them newsletters.

​With your Luma newsletter, it's easy to include your upcoming events and to filter your audience by tags.

​Highlight Community Events

​You can add events from other Calendars and even from other websites. You won't be able to manage these events, but they will be highlighted on your Calendar.

​This is a perfect way to highlight events that are created by your community.

* Article: https://help.lu.ma/p/helpart-Zn5XmZCzcTConAH/multi-session-events

```
Luma's mission is to help you host delightful events. We got our start in March 2020 during COVID to help people run online events. As many of these online events were recurring, we built the multi-session feature to make it fast and secure to batch create Zooms for them.

​In the years since, we've built more features for in-person events and paid ticketing, and in-person events have become the majority on Luma.

​As we build out these features, multi-session events have lagged behind. They don't support ticket types, restricting registration to one session, and many other useful features.

​We recognize that the multi-session feature is already complex as it is. Supporting all the new features would make it exceptionally difficult for both hosts and guests to understand. As such, we have decided to deprecate multi-session events. Starting on January 1, 2024, you won't be able to create new multi-session events on Luma.

​Instead, we'll be moving this capability to the calendar level. You can create and list multiple events on a calendar, each with its own information and access control, and as we continue to build out the calendar product, we hope it will offer a simpler, more delightful experience for frequent hosts and event-goers.

​Luma Calendar

​Luma Calendar allows you to work with your team, create many events, and share all of your upcoming events with your community. It lets you apply tags to events, set different location for each event and get a convenient map view, and more.

​We think Luma Calendar is a natural successor to multi-session events especially when we are shifting from online to offline, and we encourage you to set up a calendar and try it out.

​Calendar Overview

​FAQ

​What will happen to my existing series?

​If you already have an existing series on Luma, we will continue to support it. You can continue to add new sessions to that series until Jan 1st, 2024.

​Can I batch add events to a Luma Calendar?

​We're working on the ability to do so and should have support for it shortly.

​Can guests bulk register for events on a Luma Calendar?

​Currently, guests have a few options to quickly register or subscribe to events on a Luma Calendar:

​Guests can quickly click through events and register for them one by one. We make the UX for this very easy.
​Guests can subscribe to the events in their Google or Outlook Calendar by subscribing the Web Calendar.
​And as a host, you're able to easily add guests from past events whenever you create a new event. We will continue to streamline the registration experience for guests.

Payment + Require Approval
Luma supports collecting payment for tickets that require approval
​
Making Money
​Luma supports collecting payment for tickets that require approval. You don't need to do anything special to set this up other than toggling Require Approval and setting the price for a ticket.

​When someone registers for a ticket that requires approval, their payment method will be authorized and a hold will be placed on their card (or other payment). If you approve their registration, we will complete the charge so that the funds are captured. If you decline their registration, we will release the hold on their payment method.

​Here are some commonly associated questions:

​"Why am I seeing a charge on my card when I'm not approved?" — For some guests, it may look like the hold on their card is a charge. They should be able to look at their bank or credit card's portal to get more information. As a host, you can also look at the Guests tab to see if the payment is Pending or Completed.
​"Why can't I pay with iDEAL or another payment method?" — While we support many different payment methods, we aren't able to support all of these for Require Approval. For Require Approval we need to be able to collect the payment details and then capture the charge at a deferred time — not every payment method supports this.
​"How long does the hold last?" — This will depend on the payment method but it's typically a week. But as a host, you can collect payment even after that the hold leaves the card.
​"How can I cancel the hold on my card?" — If a guest cancels their registration, we will automatically lift the hold on their card. This may take a bit of time to show up on the card statement.
​"Can I do require approval + payment without placing holds on cards?" — As a host, you are not able to configure this.
```



* Article: https://help.lu.ma/p/helpart-0nXK7uHmN5dTYeB/payment-methods

  ```
  Once you set up your payment details, you'll be ready to start accepting payments for your events.
  
  ​For all payments, we accept major credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.
  
  ​If you are based in a country with other payment methods, you can enable other payment methods on your calendar.
  
  ​To enable other payment methods:
  
  ​Select a calendar from lu.ma/home/calendars
  ​Navigate to Settings > Payments
  ​Choose the Payment Methods you'd like to enable
  ​As of December 2024, we support:
  
  ​iDEAL
  ​Bancontact
  ​Konbini
  ​PayNow
  ​Zip
  ​TWINT
  ​Przelewy24 - P24
  ​Note: Some payment methods are not supported when your paid ticket type has 'Required Approval' enabled due to technical reasons.
  
  TRANSCRIPTION OF EMBEDED VIDEO:
  On Luma you can accept different payment methods. So for all events we default to letting you accept all major credit and debit cards, Apple Pay on devices that support it. So that'll be iOS Safari and Safari on Mac if these are set up their Apple Pay and Google Pay which is supported on Android and Chrome again if people have set it up. We also support some payment methods for other countries that are popular in those other countries. So if you go to the calendars tab here and you click on a calendar then go to settings and to payment you'll be able to turn on different payment methods for your calendar. This will apply to all events managed by this calendar. Right now we only have ideal and bank contact but we'll be adding more payment methods here and if you have one that you'd really like us to support feel free to reach out to us.

```
What countries can I accept payments from?
We support receiving payments from all countries and can pay hosts in 40+ countries.
​
FAQ
​We use Stripe as our payment processor. This has advantages and some limitations.

​If you have a Stripe account, you can link it to Luma and start accepting payments. Or we can help you create a new Stripe account.

​If you are from this list of countries, you can create a Stripe account. But your customers can come from anywhere. For example, if you are in Mexico and create a Stripe account with your Mexican bank, you can accept payment from a customer in South America.

​Once you have set up your payment details, you can accept payment via credit card, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.

​India

​Note that while Stripe says they support India, we are unable to support Stripe accounts in India due to technical limitations. We hope to resolve this.

​Alternate Payment Methods

​We don't yet support payment methods other than Stripe. We don't support PayPal or RazorPay.

​While we'd like to support more payment processors, our focus is on making Luma a delightful place to bring your community together.

* Article: https://help.lu.ma/p/helpart-ZMWfdxwnMN3oUAg/disputed-payments

```
Disputed Payments
If someone disputes a payment, you can contest it or reach out to them.
​
Making Money
​If someone buys a ticket to your event with a credit card, they may end up disputing the payment later on. This could happen for different reasons.

​For example, here are some possible reasons we've seen for people to dispute a charge:

​the purchase could be made with a stolen card
​the purchaser may not recognize the charge
​the purchaser asked for a refund but didn't receive it
​the purchaser is unhappy with your event for some reason
​If the purchaser wins the dispute, the funds will be taken from your account and returned to the purchaser. You may also pay a penalty depending on your Stripe account.

​Disputes are serious and should be dealt with promptly. If you have a high rate of disputes your account risks suspension from Stripe and Luma.

​Luma does not handle disputes on your behalf. You are responsible for refunding guests and responding to your disputes.

​We recommend reaching out to the purchaser as soon as possible to see if you can reach an agreement where they withdraw their dispute.

​You can see more documentation about disputes in Stripe's help center.

​Contesting a Dispute

​You can contest a dispute from your Stripe dashboard. In there, you'll need to provide information about your event and about the purchaser.

​You can find information about the guest timeline and purchase behavior on your Manage Event page.
```



* Article: https://help.lu.ma/p/helpart-17EQo8L41u0qkok/refunding-a-guest

```
Refunding a Guest
You can refund a guest's payment for an event.
​
Making Money
​With Luma, you can sell tickets to your events. Every so often, you'll need to issue a refund — if the guest can't make it, accidentally bought two tickets, or any other reason.

​You can issue a full refund from the Manage Event page > Guests tab.



​From the Guests tab, you can click on a guest and hit the "Refund" button.

​If you'd like to do a partial refund, you can open their transaction in Stripe and do a partial refund in Stripe.

​Refund Fees

​We don't charge any additional fee to refund a guest, but you will need to cover the original credit card transaction fee and the Luma platform fee.

​So if you have a $50 ticket with $1.75 in credit card fees and $2.50 in Luma platform fees, you'll contribute $4.25 if you are going to give the customer a full refund.

​Partial Refunds

​If you want to issue a partial refund, you can do that from your Stripe Dashboard. To do this, you'll want to find the guest, open the guest panel, and then hit "View transaction on Stripe". That will take you to a page where you can view the charge and issue a partial refund.

Calendar Memberships
Join the beta to create free and paid memberships for your calendar
​
Calendar
​As of January 2025, we now have a beta of Calendar Memberships. 

​Calendar Memberships are a great way to give special access to events and other content to your members. Calendar Memberships are great for run clubs, startup accelerators, and social clubs. 

​With a Calendar Membership you can create different tiers and choose how people can join each tier.

​You have the following price options for each tier: 

​Subscription Payment - Members will pay a fee recurring monthly or yearly. We will manage payments, updating payment information, and more. This is great for run clubs or other ongoing groups.
​One Time Payment - Members will pay an initial fee to join the group. This is great if you have a festival, conference, or event series where you have a group of events you’d like to grant access to.
​Free - Members can join without paying. This works well for interest groups or if you are requiring application.
​You’re able to set up each tier with registration questions that members fill out when they join and you can require admin approval so that applications are reviewed before members become active. 

​Once a member is active in a tier, you can grant them special access to events and other content. 

​Calendar Event List - Choose if the event list is shown to non-members. You can hide all calendar events from non members.
​Member-Only Event Visibility - You can mark an event as Member-Only so that only active members will see when viewing the calendar.
​Member-Only Newsletters - Send newsletters directly to your members.
​Member-Only Tickets (Coming Soon) - Allow members to register for special tickets. This lets you give them special pricing or access to events.
​If you’d like to join the Membership beta, please send an email to support@lu.ma with the subject as the name of your community along with answers to the following questions:

​A link to the calendar that you’d like to set up with Membership
​A few sentences about your community along with how you are running your membership today.
​How would you like to configure the membership? Free? Require approval? Multiple tiers? If it’s paid, what’s the price?
​Expected size of membership — this can be a ballpark, we just want to make sure to get you the support you need.
​When you plan on launching and onboarding members.

Create Coupons for Paid Events
Give people free or discounted access to paid events.
​
Making Money
​Sometimes you need to give people free access to your paid events, because they paid elsewhere, you want to give them a free trial, or some other reasons. To do so, you can create a coupon in Luma.

​Create Coupons

​Go to the Registration tab of your Manage Event page, and click on Create Coupon. Give it a name, and specify how many times it can be used for. Save it, and send the coupon to your guest.

​Your coupon can be:

​Free
​Percent Discount
​Amount Discount
​Also, if your event has multiple ticket types, you can choose which ticket type the coupon should be restricted to.



​Coupon Links

​You can send your guests a link that will pre-apply a coupon of your choice. You can do that by clicking on the menu button at the right of the coupon and choosing "Copy Link".

​Redeem Coupons

​When your guest goes to the event page, they can click on Use a Coupon to enter the coupon code. Then they will be able to register for your event for free, without needing to enter any payment information.

​Calendar Coupons

​Every event on Luma is managed by a Luma Calendar. If you'd like to create a coupon that can be applied for any event on the calendar, you can:

​Go to lu.ma/home/calendars
​Choose your calendar
​Navigate to Settings → Payment
​This coupon will be eligible for any event on your calendar.

Adding Hosts and Managers to Your Event
Easily manage events with your friends and team.
​
Events

​With Luma, it is easy to have co-hosts and / or managers for your events. This can be useful for scenarios like:

    ​You are co-hosting the event with others and want to list everyone involved on the event page.

    ​You have a special guest who you want to feature on the event page.

    ​There's someone on your team who you want to help manage the event.

​Adding a New Host or Manager

​Go to the manage page for your event, and you can add a new host or manager by clicking on the Add Host button.

​If the person you are adding isn't yet on Luma, you can set an avatar and name for them so that they don't need to do so themselves. If they are on Luma, we will use the information they have (which they can update in lu.ma/settings).

​Here you can choose whether the person should be shown on the event page, have access to the manage event page, or both. When you are done, click on Invite Host to add them to your event.
​Host Options

​When you add a host you have a couple options:

​Show on Event Page — This dictates if the host is listed on the public event page.

​Access Control

    ​Manager — The host has full access to the event, can send invites, manage payment, etc.

    ​Check-In Only — This requires an active Luma Plus subscription on the primary calendar for the event. Check-In hosts will be able to see the guest list and check in guests using web, iOS, or Android.

    ​Non-Manager — The host will be shown on the event page but will have no access to the event backend. 

​Hosts with the Manager role can add, remove, and manage other hosts. But the Creator of the event cannot be removed and the Creator always gets the Manager role.
​Adding a Company or Organization as a Host

​We recommend using the Luma Calendar feature to show a company as the event host.

​Luma Calendars allow you to create a Calendar for your company — that calendar will have a public page and it can have multiple admins. Calendar admins will be able to manage any event under that calendar.

​When an event is part of a Luma Calendar, the calendar name and avatar will show up on the event page.

​If you'd like to add a company a different way, you could create a dedicated Luma user account for your company like events@example.com and set up the company information on that account.

​We recommend setting up a Luma Calendar rather than creating a user account for your company.

Event Guest List
Show or hide your event guest list on the event page
​
Events

​We recommend sharing your event guest list on your event page. It's a great way to build social proof and give attendees an idea of who is going to be at the event.

​But if you'd like to have a more private list, you can hide the guest list by going to Manage Event → Guests tab and then toggling "Guest List".

TRANSCRIPTION OF EMBEDED VIDEO:
Hi, so with Luma you can share the guest list for your event on the event page itself. This is an event I haven't registered for and I see the guest list is here. If I click into it, it says that I have to register for the event to view the guest list. So once I register, I'll be able to see everyone on the guest list and get a better idea of who is coming to the event. So that's a good way to show what the event is like and to give some social proof for people who are registering. You can also turn off the guest list if you'd like. So if I go to the manage event page, so this is a new event that I've created. And if I go to the guests tab, I can go in and click on guest list and click hide guest list. And see the guest list is now hidden and it won't be shown on the event page either to people who haven't registered or to people who have registered. It's a private guest list on the manage event side. You'll still see all of the guests come in here on your manage side, but the public event page won't show the guest list. You can also update your default settings for future events. So if you go to your calendar, so if you pick a calendar, let's pick bare ventures and then you go to your settings. Then options, you have some event defaults here. So public guest list, you can turn this on and off and then all future events on that calendar will have that setting set when you first create the event. But then when you, after you create the event, you can always go in and update it specifically for that event. [BLANK_AUDIO]

Check In Guests for In Person Events
Scan guests tickets to check them in for in person events. This helps you manage who joins your event and gives you attendance.
​
Events

​If you are hosting an in person event, you will be able to check in guests as they arrive in order to verify their registration and to keep attendance.

​Guests will receive a QR code in their email that you can scan when they come to the event. You can also search for their name on the guest list to check them in manually.

​We recommend using our iOS app (lu.ma/ios) or our Android app (lu.ma/android) to make the check-in process seamless.

​When you scan a guest's ticket, you'll see their information along with their current registration status. You'll also see a button to check them in (or to undo their check in), it will not automatically check them in.

​Note that you will first need to open the Luma scanner via web, iOS app, or Android app before scanning a guest's QR code. You cannot scan from your phone's camera app.

​iOS App

​In the iOS app, you can sync your phone's contacts to invite anyone in your contacts to your event.

​If you sync over contacts, you'll be able to invite people by phone number, if you don't have their email. So this is a great way to send SMS invites to your friends.

​Require Approval

​Note that if your event or ticket has Require Approval on, inviting guests will bypass this setting. If someone registers from an invite, they will be automatically approved.
​Adding Guests

​You can also add guests directly to your event. When you add a guest, they will be marked as Going and will not need to accept the invite.

​Additionally, when you add a guest, we send them a calendar invite that should automatically add the event to their calendar.

​This is a great way to add VIPs or people who have already opted into joining your event.

TRANSCRIPTION OF EMBEDED VIDEO:
Hi, I'm going to show you how to invite and add people to your event. So both of these flows will go through the invite guest button on the event page or in the iOS app. On the iOS app, we don't support adding guests directly yet, but you can invite people. So let's take a look at what that looks like. When I hit invite guests, I see a few different things here. One is I see a list of suggestions that I can search over and then choose people from that suggestion list. I also see a place where I can enter in emails. If I have no emails entered, I can drop in a CSV so I can import a bunch of emails at once. That being said, please be careful to only upload emails that have consented to receive invites from you. If you invite people who don't have active emails or don't want to see the emails from you, you risk your account getting suspended. But if you have a list of emails from MailChimp or HubSpot or some other CRM tool, feel free to drop them in here. We can also look at past events and see people we've invited to those events or people who went to those events. And then on the calendar level, if we tag people, we can filter based on those tags there. So let's just invite one person. And on this screen, we'll see that this is a preview of the invite. People will receive an invite via email. If they have their phone number linked, they'll receive a text message. And if they have the Luma iOS app with notifications, they'll receive a notification in app as well. So we can include a custom message here. This is just plain text because it'll go via text message as well. So we would love to have you join. And that's it. That's super easy. We can click here, send invites, and that invite will set. One thing to note is that for events that have approval required or for any ticket that has approval required, if you invite somebody, they will be automatically approved once they register. So they're not going to go through the additional approval process. So it's a great way to invite VIPs to these type of events because you won't have to improve them. So I can go in and send invites. And that will send, as I said, an email and potentially a text message or push notification if they have connected their phone or their email. Or their phone or the Luma iOS app. The other thing to look at now, and we can see here, Holly is invited because we've invited him, is adding guests to an event. So if you have a group of VIPs who you don't want to register or if your event requires payment and they've paid some other place, you can add them directly to the event, which will skip the invited state and add them to the event. So this is Victor plus new at Luma will hit enter. So we're going to add somebody by their email and we'll hit next and here we'll hit add guests directly. So this is going to put them directly in the going states. They'll receive an email with a calendar invite that if their calendar like has given us permissions, most calendars will automatically add the calendar invite to their calendar. So this is a good tool if you know you have a series of people coming to the same event and they want to be coming in the future, you can add them directly to your event list. But this is please be careful here again only add people who want to be added to the event. But it's pretty much the same flow. You have all the same ways of selecting people and then you can add them directly to the event.

Understanding Import and Event Invite Limits
Different plans allow you to invite more people to your event but you can always have unlimited registrations.
​
Luma Plus

​When you create an event on Luma, you can start sharing that link to collect registrations. You can collect unlimited registrations whether you are on the free plan or on the paid plan.

​We restrict the number of invites that you are allowed to send out. When you invite someone to your event, Luma will send them an email asking them if they would like to register.

​For new accounts, you can send about 15 invites per week, but there are ways where you can increase this limit:

    ​verify your email address

    ​link a verified phone number

    ​send invites / emails that don't go to spam

    ​chat with us and give us more information about the type of events you are hosting and how you got your email list

    ​pay for Luma Plus

​You can see how many invites you have remaining on your Luma Plus settings. Your invites reset on a rolling basis — so if you send 10 invites today, they will reset 7 days from today.

Setting your Event Visibility
Learn more about your event’s Visibility settings and how you can set it for your event.
​
Events

​Your Luma event’s visibility can either be Public or Private. In particular:

​Public: Public events are shown on your calendar and eligible to be featured on other calendars, such as our Discover calendars (lu.ma/discover). Public events can also be indexed by search engines like Google and Bing.

​Private: A private event will be unlisted and won’t be shown in any Luma calendar, including your own. Only people with the link can register. Search engines will be asked not to index private events.

​You can set the visibility of your event when you create it. You can also change the visibility of the event from the Manage Event > Overview tab.

​If you scroll to the bottom of that tab, you'll see something that looks like this:
​Default Visibility

​To set a default visibility for new events in your calendar:

​Head over to lu.ma/home/calendars > your calendar > Settings > Options > Event Visibility. From here, you can choose to set all future events to be Public or Private, along with other settings.

​Note: Changes to event defaults won’t affect existing events in the calendar.
​Location Visibility

​If you'd like to hide the location of the event to approved guests, you can look at Hiding Your Event Location. This is separate setting from "Event Visibility".

Merging Luma Accounts
You can add multiple emails to your Luma account.
​
Helpful Tips

​We recommend having one Luma account per person. That ensures you can see all of your upcoming events in one place without switching between accounts.

​You can link your Luma accounts in your Luma Settings page.

​When you link an additional email, all invites sent to that email will be linked to your primary Luma account.

​If you already have an existing Luma account with an email you'd like to link, you'll need to log into that account and delete it. Then you'll be able to link it.

​We aren't able to merge two Luma accounts on the backend.

​As a reminder, if you'd simply like to change your email, you can do so any time at lu.ma/settings.
​Linking Phone Number

​As for phone numbers, you can link your phone number to your Luma account but you can have at most one phone number linked.

​Additionally, you can only link your phone number to one account.

​If you'd like to transfer the phone number that your Luma account is linked to, you can sign in to that account (you can sign into Luma via phone number) and then unlink your phone number from that account via lu.ma/settings.

​Once your phone number is not linked to the previous account, you can link the phone number to the desired account.

What countries can I accept payments from?

FAQ

​We use Stripe as our payment processor. This has advantages and some limitations.

​If you have a Stripe account, you can link it to Luma and start accepting payments. Or we can help you create a new Stripe account.

​If you are from this list of countries, you can create a Stripe account. But your customers can come from anywhere. For example, if you are in Mexico and create a Stripe account with your Mexican bank, you can accept payment from a customer in South America.

​Once you have set up your payment details, you can accept payment via credit card, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.
​India

​Note that while Stripe says they support India, we are unable to support Stripe accounts in India due to technical limitations. We hope to resolve this.
​Alternate Payment Methods

​We don't yet support payment methods other than Stripe. We don't support PayPal or RazorPay.

​While we'd like to support more payment processors, our focus is on making Luma a delightful place to bring your community together.

​You'll be taken through the flow of setting up your Stripe Account or linking an existing account.
​Finding Payouts in Stripe

​You can find your bank information as well as the list of payouts in your Stripe Dashboard. To find the correct Stripe account, you should:

    ​Open lu.ma/home/calendars

    ​Click "Open Stripe"

    ​You can also find your Stripe Account ID by clicking on the three dots and then clicking "Stripe Account ID"

​For every payment in Luma, we also provide a way of opening the corresponding payment in Stripe. If you scroll down on the same Calendar > Payments tab, you'll see a Sales History section and each transaction will have a link to Stripe.
​Products and Taxes in Stripe

​Luma does not create a Stripe Product for events or ticket sales. Additionally, we do not use the Stripe Tax feature so you will not be able to find any tax information in Stripe.

​You can find tax information in Luma, we cover that in separate support articles.
